## Overview

### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
- I started the challenge with the HTML section putting in it the basic sections of the design then i proceeded to the CSS section to design it to the look of the designs provided.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- I gained a lot in this challenge but to meVtion a few I'll summarize it all in the following:
** I learnt how to make an image fit nicely into its parent.
** I learnt how to use the value "space-around" in flexbox.

### Continued development

- I'll like to work more on how to use the style "position".
- I'll love to explore the different values under the "background-image" style.
- Coding faster and effectively is the dream of every programmer so I'll love to work more on that.
