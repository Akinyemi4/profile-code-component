## My process
- I started the challenge with the HTML section putting in it the basic sections of the design then i proceeded to the CSS section to design it to the look of the designs provided.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- I gained a lot in this challenge but to meVtion a few I'll summarize it all in the following:
** I learnt how to make an image fit nicely into its parent.
** I learnt how to use the value "space-around" in flexbox.

### Continued development

- I'll like to work more on how to use the style "position".
- I'll love to explore the different values under the "background-image" style.
- Coding faster and effectively is the dream of every programmer so I'll love to work more on that.

### Useful resources

- [How to use background image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Backgrounds_and_Borders/Using_multiple_backgrounds) - This helped me to understand how to use multiple background images.
